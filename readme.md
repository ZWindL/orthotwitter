## Why Orthotwitter?
(generated by ChatGPT)
It's designed to enhance your Twitter web experience.
As we all know, Twitter is an essential tool for staying connected with friends,
family, and the world around us.
However, the default Twitter interface can be cluttered and overwhelming at
times. That's where this extension comes in.

This extension aims to provide a sleek and streamlined UI, with features such as
the removal of the bulky header and the analytics of each tweet. I believe that
these small changes will greatly improve your overall Twitter experience. By
removing the bulky header, you will be able to focus more on the content that
matters to you. And by removing the analytics of each tweet, you'll be able to
enjoy the content without being distracted by metrics.

## Why not an entirely new 3rd-party web site?
Because Twitter just blocked all API requests from 3rd-party applications.
